# -- Recipes for Potions --

# name: Different names for bad/normal/good (Formatting codes possible: such as &6)
# ingredients: List of 'material,data/amount'
#   (Item-ids instead of material are not supported by bukkit anymore and will not work)
#   A list of materials can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
#   You can specify a data (durability) value, omitting it will ignore the data value of the added ingredient
#   If Vault is installed normal names can be used instead of material or id, so using Vault is highly recommended.
#   Vault will recognize things like "Jungle Leaves" instead of "LEAVES,3"
# cookingtime: Time in real minutes ingredients have to boil
# distillruns: How often it has to be distilled for full alcohol (0=without distilling)
# distilltime: How long (in seconds) one distill-run takes (0=Default time of 40 sec) MC Default would be 20 sec
# wood: Wood of the barrel 0=any 1=Birch 2=Oak 3=Jungle 4=Spruce 5=Acacia 6=Dark Oak
# age: Time in Minecraft-days, the potion has to age in a barrel 0=no aging
# color: Color of the potion after distilling/aging.
#   Usable Colors: DARK_RED, RED, BRIGHT_RED, ORANGE, PINK, BLUE, CYAN, WATER, GREEN, BLACK, GREY, BRIGHT_GREY
# difficulty: 1-10 accuracy needed to get good quality (1 = unaccurate/easy, 10 = very precise/hard)
# alcohol: Absolute amount of alcohol 0-100 in a perfect potion (will be added directly to the player, where 100 means fainting)
# effects: List of effect/level/duration  Special potion-effect when drinking, duration in sek.
#   Suffix name with 'X' to hide effect from label. Sample: 'POISONX/2/10' (WEAKNESS, INCREASE_DAMAGE, SLOW and SPEED are always hidden.)
#   Effects are always hidden in 1.9 and newer, because of changes in the potion mechanics.
#   Possible Effects: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html
#   Level or Duration ranges may be specified with a "-", ex. 'SPEED/1-2/30-40' = lvl 1 and 30 sec at worst and lvl 2 and 40 sec at best
#   Ranges also work high-low, ex. 'POISON/3-1/20-5' for weaker effects at good quality.
#   Highest possible Duration: 1638 sec. Instant Effects dont need any duration specified.

# More Recipes ideas: Cachaca, Gin, Whiskey, Tequila, Cider, etc. as well as high quality abbreviations like golden vodka etc.
# I will not add more Recipes to the default config, as they would be public and viewable by users to cheat.
# It is up to the Serveradmin to change and add Recipes, so players cannot cheat from the default config.
